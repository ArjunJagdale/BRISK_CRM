### Overview

This project is a **CRM Dashboard UI** designed to help sales and operations teams efficiently manage leads, track performance, and take timely actions. The focus is on **clarity, workflow efficiency, and decision-making**, rather than visual decoration.

The dashboard supports the complete lead lifecycle—from lead generation to conversion—while providing managers with high-level performance insights.
